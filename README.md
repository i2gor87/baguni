# ðŸ§º Baguni

Baguni is a Korean word for 'basket' and it's also the name of this most simple and lightweight package for managing state across React components.

Baguni's primary goal is to redefine the use of state in React, traditionally managed by the `useState` hook. While `useState` is limited to the scope of a single component, `useBaguni` breaks these boundaries, allowing developers to share the state of a single variable across multiple components seamlessly.

In case if there is a necessity for more complex state management, preserving state and/or use of utilities/extensions, something like [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) or [Jotai](https://github.com/pmndrs/jotai) could suit better, but before making a decision, you may want to read [why sections](#why-use-baguni-if-i-can-use-library-name) first

## Features

- **Simple and Lightweight**: Designed as drop-in replacement for `useState` in React.
- **State Sharing**: Effortlessly share state between components.
- **React Friendly**: Works out of the box with existing React/Nextjs applications.
- **No Boilerplate**: Reduce the need for complex state management setups.
- **No learning curve**: If you know `useState`, you know `useBaguni`.
- **Typescript ready**: Use it with javascript or typescript as you want.
- **Smallest state management library**: 1582 bytes (1106 without declaration file)
- **No dependencies**: The only dependency is `react` itself

## Why use Baguni if I can use `library-name`

- Simple
- Lightweight
- Easy to set up
- No need to learn syntax or API - just replace existing `useState` with `useBaguni`

## Standalone versions

If you don't want to install the package, you may just copy `standalone/baguni-standalone.js/.ts` to your project and use it as you like.

## Installation

```bash
npm install baguni
```

## Usage

### Create your very first app-scoped variable

```typescript
// src/lib/variables.ts
import { createBaguni } from "baguni";
export const APP_COUNTER = createBaguni<number>(0);
```

### Use it anywhere

```typescript
// src/components/component.tsx
import { useBaguni } from "baguni";
import { APP_COUNTER } from "../lib/variables";

const Component = () => {
  const [appCounter] = useBaguni(APP_COUNTER);
  return <div>Counter: {appCounter}</div>;
};

export default Component;
```

### Modify state from anywhere

```typescript
// src/components/button.tsx
import { useBaguni } from "baguni";
import { APP_COUNTER } from "../lib/variables";

const Button = () => {
  const [counter, setAppCounter] = useBaguni(APP_COUNTER);
  return (
    <button
      onClick={() = {
        setAppCounter(counter + 1);
      }}
    >Add 1 to counter</button>
  );
};

export default Button;
```

### Get value outside of components

```typescript
// src/api/get_current_counter_value.ts
import { APP_COUNTER } from "../lib/variables";
const getCurrentCounterValue = () => {
  const counter = APP_COUNTER.get();
  console.log("counter value: ", counter);
};
```

## Variability

What works for `useState`, works for `useBaguni` as well

```typescript
export const simpleString = createBaguni<string>("");
export const simpleNumber = createBaguni<number>(0);
export const simpleArray = createBaguni<[]>([]);
```
